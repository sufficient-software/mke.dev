    This will be the new home of the next incarnation of the RokkinCat Hack &amp; Tell event.
    The current organizer is Nick Gartmann, but I am looking for help.
    If you are interested in attending (or helping in any way) please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/UyBL18QLQa4x69rg7">this form</a> with your thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have attended a Hack &amp; Tell in the past, you will be receiving an email with details about the next event once we have it planned.
    I expect news about our first event under the new organization to be available in March of 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for your patience as we figure out our new direction.
    <br />
    &mdash; Nick Gartmann
